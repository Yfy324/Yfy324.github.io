I present my work at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC) in Thessaloniki, Greece.</p>
<p>In my talk, I revisited the classic tool of passivity theory—traditionally used for analyzing undirected networks—and extended it to a class of directed networks known as balanced digraphs. These results offer new insights into achieving stability in nonlinear multi-agent systems with directed interactions, which is an important step toward a broader theory of passivity for directed systems.</p>
<p>Due to the conflict between Israel and Iran, getting to ECC was quite an adventure—I traveled through Jordan, Egypt, and Turkey before finally arriving in Greece. It was a challenging but memorable trip, and I had a lot of fun at the conference.</p>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This work deals with the output consensus problems for multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. While passivity-based approaches are widely used for analyzing undirected consensus protocols, we show that they are generally not applicable to the directed linear consensus protocol. To address this limitation, we propose a general approach that enables a passivity-based analysis for network systems with directed couplings. Then, we mitigate the complexity introduced by nonlinearities and directed interconnections by reformulating the general output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. Within this framework, we further focus on the stabilization problem, a specific form of the output consensus problem, and establish a sufficient passivity-based condition for stabilizing multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</p>
